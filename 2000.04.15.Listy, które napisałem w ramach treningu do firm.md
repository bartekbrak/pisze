Just for my records, a selection of e-mails I'd like to preserve for whatever
reason.

### Slack

```

Dear Slack.

I like, use and recommend your product to the companies I work for. I'ma a fan.  But, Id' like to suggest an improvement in the Linux app. When it launches it tries raise its window at least two times which annoys me. Every day in the morning I turn on Slack, then some other apps, Slack is slow to start (another issue but hey, it's a complex app) so I have time to start another app after launching it, then, when I see it, Slack places itself before the other app. Once is fine, there is now ay to avoid it, so I alt-tab to another app, and then SLack does it again. That's how I start every day,. by being annoyed with Slack.
Hope that helps.

Dear ZeroCopter.

I'm a strong backend developer focusing on Python and databases. I have been programming for ~6 years for biggest Python houses in Warsaw and have been using Linux for around 15 years. I don't know Ruby but say a word and I'll start learning, re-building my personal projects in Ruby to get the hang of it, feel how it's different to Python and before the severance period with my current company finishes, I should be able to understand the code and possibly write something of value, I've done it before with other technologies, I learn from books.

Besides crafting my Python and database skills I focus on the meta level of programming, seeking areas of improving myself and the team that are less obvious but impactful. I design systems, write useful, clear documentation. I care about discoverability of my code, strive for minimalism and efficiency, I know where to cut corners and where not to, most of the time. I am ambitious, I expect competence and strive for delivering it myself.

I have worked previously for a Dutch client (LegalSense in Utrecht) and enjoyed the professionalism I was offered and required to give. The flight to Amsterdam takes about 2hrs from Warsaw so I can manage. I have read the Wikipedia article on your country, have thoroughly enjoyed how Waterschappen persistently defends you from coastal erosion. Thank you for reading up to this point and sorry about the silliness! :)

Please consider me for the position of a remote member of your team. Let's chat.
