# About Bartek Brak

Linguist turned programmer, from Welsh through Esperanto to Python, I am
interested in all languages, human or programming. Now studying Natural
Language Processing, used to deliver large-scale translation mechanisms in the
retail industry. A humble student of best programming practices in elusive
pursuit of reaching happiness through the Zen of Python. In my free time, I
polish my teaching skills by sharing knowledge of Python ecosystem and Unix
toolchain.
