## devops

> Propose a way to deploy a Python Django application.

- how to store code?

    git, centralized server, github, gitlab

- how to move code?

    docker images, git clone, scp, ansible

- how to boostrap code (run scripts needed for app to run, like migrate)

    remote scripts, docker entry point, fabric, ansible playbooks

- how to run code?

    wsgi, supervisord,

- how to serve code

    nginx, apache,

- how to minimize/avoid downtime

    load balancer, nighttime deploys, just make deploy fast by skill, ready to quickly roll back
    have staging/CI/QA to avoid fuckups, code review

- how to configure production app, how to store secrets?

    separate configs, read env, limit access to production environments

## Python open-ended questions, don't talk for too long

> what is challenging in development, and specifically Python?

- testing

    there are many kinds of tests, there is no right one for you, you need experience in many to choose wisely

- plethora of solutions

    mature ecosystem usually offers too many things, flask or django,
sqlalchemy or django orm

- balance between progressive / conservative choices

    should one use the new coolest and possibly win something or be risk
avoiding and stay with known solutions with slightly older versions

- feature creep

    how to build useful (many features) but maintainable system (little
features but stable)

> How to build a smart team, what skills and decisions are needed?

- different levels of competence, from junior to senior

- not focus on technology only, think values and atmosphere through

- trust and freedom

## Python specific questions

> Describe feature history of Python from 2.6 to 3.6, don't be specific, don't
touch all versions, touch on main points

    2.6 base for comparison, c'mon nobody knows, but... with statement, user
site-packages, multiprocessing
    2.7 dict comprehensions, argparse
    3.0 breaking changes, we don't care which but... print as function, unicode
strings as base, super syntax, more generator and iterator defaults, many others
    3.1, 3.2, 3.3 maturing, many small unimportant changes
    3.4 asyncio, pathlib
    3.5 typing
    3.6 f-strings, faster dict implementation (matters for everything, as dicts
are everywhere, eveyr object has some dicts),  asynchronous generators

value: shows interest in Python in general, proxy for breadth of technical
stack, be lax, no-one knows this list, everyone has to know at lest one thing

> simple, why is `with open` important?

> why circular import happen, how to solve them

    lay out code differently
    in-line imports when lazy

## Linux questions

- name 3 major linux distributions
- name 2 ways of distributing software (apt/deb/debian/ubuntu,
yum/rpm/redhat/centos, dnf/fedora, apk/alpine)
- try to name one linux tool for every letter of the alphabet (a - apt, b -
bzip, c - cat, d - dd, e - echo), after 5 or so say "thanks, that's awesome,
you know it, as this is a killer usually)
- what is the standard linux disk format? (ext4, or ext2, ext3, ext whetever is
fine, shows he actually worked with linux for some time)

## text editor / IDE qustions

- describe how you work with your favourite editor/IDE, what do you like about
it, what does it lack?
