        # Time tracking for the paranoid.

        Bartek

        github.com/bartekbrak

        I can Python, I like data, too much---

## Context

* Some companies have their own product, some work for multiple clients.
* Then some of us have to track time spent on a given task, specific project
 or client because... budgets. Lucky you who don't! It gets annoying.
* Multiple solutions are already there: toggl, harvest, RescueTime,
  hamster, internal ones...
* And I hate them all
  * they rarely do what I want,
  * often impossible to extend,
  * have a terminal client (and bash_completions)
  * work off-line

---

## What do I want?

* If I'm spending time on paperwork, I want to have full
  control, ability to process that data... and go PARANOID:

  * visualize my work patterns
  * do useful stats - focus factor
  * tell me how much I've worked "right now" when my working hours are
    irregular and when is *enough*
  * answer questions like
    * What is my typical productivity?
    * How does it change when working remotely?
    * What are my break patterns?
    * Is the task nearing its time budget?

* Accept the inconvenience


---

## Should I, should anyone?

* Probably not, you might be focusing on the wrong problem...

* Some people might take it the wrong way :|

* Maybe just change the job if they make you do stupid things?

* Meh... You want to know!

---

## Here's my app

* Alpha, POC, dirty, bad but working code, really bad frontend but
  who cares

* Not ready for use unless you try hard

* Keep it minimal, throw away and rewrite when idea matures.

* Django, only four models

* No tests, you mad?!
---

## Conclusion

* typically 63% focus factor - 5hours 2minutes 24 seconds :P

* Remotely +16%, that's ~6hours more of pure focused work per week (but I tried
  hard). That's what I wanted to know!

* Visualizing helped, funny to see how I wake up later and later as the week
  progresses. ---
